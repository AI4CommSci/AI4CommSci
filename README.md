# Welcome to the AI4CommSci Lab GitHub

## About AI4CommSci
The rapid advances in artificial intelligence don’t just change how we interact with our speakers, choose TV shows to watch, or search for information online. They also change what kind of science is possible and expand what is knowable. Established in 2024, our group’s vision is to push the envelope of what is possible, making breakthroughs in theory and practice for the communication sciences.

In addition to conducting cutting-edge research, we aim to enhance the productivity of the field as a whole. We achieve this by:

- Training junior scholars to excel in communication sciences and AI.
- Disseminating state-of-the-art methods, algorithms, and technologies.

## What We Do
- Our research spans several exciting threads within AI and communication sciences. While space limitations prevent us from detailing everything, feel free to check our work on [FormosanBank](https://github.com/FormosanBank/FormosanBank)
